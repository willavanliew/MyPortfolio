Analysis of Avalanche Accidents and Fatalities in the United States from 1950 to 2022.

Data is available thanks to Colorado Avalanche Information Center <a href="https://avalanche.state.co.us/accidents/statistics-and-reporting" target="_blank">(CAIC)</a>

## Background

I have been skiing for a very long time. As a child my father would put on ski movies after a long day on the slopes, most of the movies we would watch would have at least one scene of a professional skier or snowboarder riding down a slope as an avalanche is triggered. Much like quicksand I thought avalanches would be a very big worry as a grew older, but when one skis at a sanctioned ski resort avalanche dangers are slim to none if you are careful.

But I was still curious about them, I wanted to know when they actually occur and how they are triggered. I came across an expansive data set from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center and attempted to answer some of the questions I had.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(usmap)
library(ggiraph)
library(patchwork)
library(magick)
library(plotly)
library(htmltools)
library(htmlwidgets)

states <- usmap::us_map()
accidents <- read_csv("./data/Accidents_2022_PUBLIC (1).csv")
accidents <- rename(accidents, dSize = `D Size`)
accidents = accidents %>%
  mutate(TravelMode = ifelse(TravelMode %in% c("SKi", "Ski"), "Ski", TravelMode)) %>%
  mutate(PrimaryActivity = ifelse(PrimaryActivity %in% c("Mechanised Guide", "Mechanized Guide"), "Mechanised Guide", PrimaryActivity)) %>%
  mutate(state_full = state.name[match(State,state.abb)])

accidents

cbp1 <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73",
          "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
          
```

## The Data

The variables present in the data set include copious information about time, location, trigger type, travel mode of those stuck in the avalanche and fatalities.

I was most interested in the basic location, travel mode, fatalities and year.

### Have avalanche accidents and fatalities increased over the years?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
a_year = accidents %>%
  group_by(YYYY) %>%
  summarize(totalIncidents = n(), totalDeaths = sum(Killed))
  
a_year = gather(a_year, "type", "count", -YYYY)

```

```{r}
a_year %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = YYYY, y = count, color = type), linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Have Avalanche Accidents and Deaths Increased Over Time?", 
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Events",
       caption = "Data: Colorado Avalanche Information Center") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#E69F00", "#0072B2"),name = "Type",  labels = c("Death","Avalanche"))+
  theme_minimal()

```

### Which states have highest concentration of avalanche accidents?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
accidents %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(total_accidents = n()) %>%
  filter(total_accidents > 1) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(y = total_accidents, x = fct_reorder(State, desc(total_accidents)))) +
  labs(title = "Which State has the Highest Number of Avalanches?",
       x = "State",
       y = "Total Accidents") +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
accidents_state = accidents %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(total_accidents = n(), total_deaths = sum(Killed)) %>%
  filter(total_accidents > 1) 

accidents_state = gather(accidents_state, "type", "count", -State)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
accidents_state %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = fct_reorder(State, desc(count)), y = count, fill = type), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Which State Has the Highest Number of Avalanche Accidents?", 
       x = "State", 
       y = "Number of Accidents") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkgreen", "darkred"), name = "Type", labels = c("Avalanche", "Death")) +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r}
#| echo: false

states_count = accidents %>%
  group_by(state_full, State)%>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(full = state_full)

states_count = states_count %>%
  mutate(bin = cut(count, breaks = c(0,1,10,20,80, 100, 120, 200, 300)))

states2 = full_join(states, states_count, by = "full")

states2 = states2 %>%
  mutate(count = ifelse(is.na(count), 0, count))
```

```{r}
single = paste0(states2$full,"<br>",states2$count," Accident", sep="")
multiple = paste0(states2$full,"<br>",states2$count," Accidents", sep="")

mappedCounts <- states2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y, 
             group = group,
             data_id = full)) +
  geom_polygon_interactive(color = "grey45", 
                           fill = "grey", 
                           aes(tooltip = ifelse(count > 0, ifelse(count > 1, multiple, single), paste0(full,"<br>No Avalanche Accidents", sep="")))) + 
  labs(title="Avalanche Accidents",subtitle = "From April 1951 to May 2022")+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank())

graphedCount = states_count %>%
  filter(count >0)%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_col_interactive(aes(x = fct_reorder(full,count),
                           y = count, 
                           tooltip = ifelse(count > 1, paste0(full,"<br>",count," Accidents", sep=""),paste0(full,"<br>",count," Accident", sep="")), 
                           data_id = full))+
  labs(x = "State", y = "Number of Accidents", caption = "Data: Colorado Avalanche Information Center")+
  theme_minimal()+
  coord_flip()

p = mappedCounts/graphedCount

girafe(ggobj = p, width_svg = 4.5, height_svg = 5.5,options = list(opts_sizing(rescale = TRUE, width = .75)))

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

q = mappedCounts + graphedCount
intergraphic = girafe(ggobj = q, width_svg = 4.5, height_svg = 5.5,options = list(opts_sizing(rescale = TRUE, width = .75)))

#htmltools::save_html(intergraphic, "~/Documents/DS-Masters/CWD/Presentations/img/av_map.html")
```

```{r}

recentAccidents = accidents %>%
  filter(YYYY > 1999)
  
recentAccidents = recentAccidents%>%
  mutate(PrimaryActivity = ifelse(Killed > 1, paste0(PrimaryActivity,"s"), PrimaryActivity))
```

### Where did these events occur in recent years?

```{r}
g <- list(
  scope = 'usa',
  projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),
  showland = TRUE,
  landcolor = toRGB("gray95"),
  subunitcolor = toRGB("gray85"),
  countrycolor = toRGB("gray85"),
  countrywidth = 0.5,
  subunitwidth = 0.5
)

fig <- plot_geo(recentAccidents, lat = ~lat, lon = ~lon)
fig <- fig %>% add_markers(
    text = ~paste(Location, 
                  paste("State:",state_full), 
                  paste(Killed, PrimaryActivity, "Died"), 
                  Date, sep = "<br />"),
    color = ~factor(Killed), symbol = I("diamond"), size = I(8), hoverinfo = "text"
  )
fig <- fig %>% layout(legend=list(title=list(text='<b> # of Deaths </b>')))
fig <- fig %>% layout(
    title = 'Avalanche Deaths In United States <br /> (From January 2000 to May 2022)',
    geo = g
  )

fig

#htmlwidgets::saveWidget(fig, "~/Documents/DS-Masters/CWD/Presentations/img/fig.html", selfcontained=TRUE, libdir = "lib")
```

### Does mode of transportation impact the number of accidents?

```{r}
accidents %>%
  filter(TravelMode %in% c("Foot", "Ski", "Snowboard", "Snowshoe", "Snowmobile")) %>%
  group_by(TravelMode) %>%
  summarize(total_accidents = n(), total_deaths = sum(Killed)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(TravelMode, desc(total_accidents)), y = total_accidents)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title= "Which Mode of Transportation has the Highest Number of Accidents?",
    x = "Travel Type",
    y = "Number of Avalanches"
  )+
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
travel_type = accidents %>%
  filter(TravelMode %in% c("Foot", "Ski", "Snowboard", "Snowshoe", "Snowmobile")) %>%
  group_by(TravelMode) %>%
  summarize(total_accidents = n(), total_deaths = sum(Killed))

travel_type = gather(travel_type, "type", "count", -TravelMode)

```

```{r}
travel_type %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = fct_reorder(TravelMode, desc(count)), y = count, fill = type), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Accidents and Deaths for the Top Modes of Transportation?", 
       x = "Travel Mode", 
       y = "Number of Accidents") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkgreen", "darkred"), name = "Type", labels = c("Avalanche", "Death"))+
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
