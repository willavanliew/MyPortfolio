Analysis of Avalanche Incidents and Fatalities in the United States from 1950 to 2022.

Data is available thanks to Colorado Avalanche Information Center <a href="https://avalanche.state.co.us/accidents/statistics-and-reporting" target="_blank">(CAIC)</a>

## Background
I have been skiing for a very long time. As a child my father would put on ski movies after a long day on the slopes, most of the movies we would watch would have at least one scene of a professional skier or snowboarder riding down a slope as an avalanche is triggered. 
Much like quicksand I thought avalanches would be a very big worry as a grew older, but when one skis at a sanctioned ski resort avalanche dangers are slim to none if you are careful. 

But I was still curious about them, I wanted to know when they actually occur and how they are triggered. I came across an expansive data set from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center and attempted to answer some of the questions I had. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(wesanderson)
library(gganimate)
accidents = read_csv("./data/Accidents_2022_PUBLIC (1).csv")
accidents = rename(accidents, dSize = `D Size`)
accidents = accidents %>%
  mutate(TravelMode = ifelse(TravelMode %in% c("SKi", "Ski"), "Ski", TravelMode))
cbp1 <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73",
          "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
```
## The Data 
The variables present in the data set include copious information about time, location, trigger type, travel mode of those stuck in the avalanche and fatalities.
```{r}
names(accidents)
```
I was most interested in the basic location, travel mode, fatalities and year. 

### Have Avalanche Incidents and Fatalities increased over the years?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
a_year = accidents %>%
  group_by(YYYY) %>%
  summarize(totalIncidents = n(), totalDeaths = sum(Killed))
  
a_year = gather(a_year, "type", "count", -YYYY)

```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
a_year %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = YYYY, y = count, color = type), linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Have Avalanche Incidents and Deaths Increased Over Time?", 
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Events") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#E69F00", "#0072B2"), name = "Incident Type", labels = c("Death","Avalanche"))+
  theme_minimal()
```

### Does mode of transportation impact the number of accidents?
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
accidents %>%
  filter(TravelMode %in% c("Foot", "Ski", "Snowboard", "Snowshoe")) %>%
  group_by(TravelMode) %>%
  summarize(total_accidents = n(), total_deaths = sum(Killed)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(TravelMode, desc(total_accidents)), y = total_accidents)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title= "Which Mode of Transportation has the Highest Number of Incidents?",
    x = "Travel Type",
    y = "Number of Avalanches"
  )+
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
travel_type = accidents %>%
  filter(TravelMode %in% c("Foot", "Ski", "Snowboard", "Snowshoe")) %>%
  group_by(TravelMode) %>%
  summarize(total_accidents = n(), total_deaths = sum(Killed))

travel_type = gather(travel_type, "type", "count", -TravelMode)

```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
travel_type %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = fct_reorder(TravelMode, desc(count)), y = count, fill = type), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "What is the distribution of accidents and deaths for the top modes of transportation?", 
       x = "Travel Mode", 
       y = "Number of Incidents") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkgreen", "darkred"), name = "Incident Type", labels = c("Avalanche", "Death"))
```

### Which States have highest consentration of Avalanche Accidents?

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
accidents %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(total_accidents = n()) %>%
  filter(total_accidents > 1) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(y = total_accidents, x = fct_reorder(State, desc(total_accidents)))) +
  labs(title = "Which State has the Highest Number of Avalanches?",
       x = "State",
       y = "Total Accidents") +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
accidents_state = accidents %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(total_accidents = n(), total_deaths = sum(Killed)) %>%
  filter(total_accidents > 1) 

accidents_state = gather(accidents_state, "type", "count", -State)

```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
accidents_state %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = fct_reorder(State, desc(count)), y = count, fill = type), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Which State Has the highest number of avalanche incidents?", 
       x = "State", 
       y = "Number of Incidents") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkgreen", "darkred"), name = "Incident Type", labels = c("Avalanche", "Death")) +
  theme_minimal()

```
