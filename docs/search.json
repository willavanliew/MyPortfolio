    "text": "Background\nRavelry is one of the largest online fiber works sites available. I use the platform to find new and exciting patterns to knit for myself and my firends and family. In October of 2022 Tidy Tuesday shared yarn data available on Ravelry to the data science community for analysis. The code I reviewed for my analysis comes from GitHub user Alice Walsh\n\nOriginal Data Set\n\nhead(yarn)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 24\n  discontinued gauge…¹ grams    id machi…² max_g…³ min_g…⁴ name  perma…⁵ ratin…⁶\n  <lgl>          <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <lgl>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr> <chr>     <dbl>\n1 FALSE              4   198  2059 TRUE         NA      17 Supe… red-he…    3.58\n2 FALSE              4   170  3330 TRUE         NA      18 Simp… caron-…    4.03\n3 FALSE              4   100   523 NA           20      18 Casc… cascad…    4.48\n4 FALSE              4   100  5741 TRUE         NA      16 Vann… lion-b…    3.87\n5 FALSE              4   100  1666 NA           NA      18 Wors… malabr…    4.73\n6 FALSE              4   100 62569 TRUE         22      18 Rios  malabr…    4.81\n# … with 14 more variables: rating_count <dbl>, rating_total <dbl>,\n#   texture <chr>, thread_size <dbl>, wpi <dbl>, yardage <dbl>,\n#   yarn_company_name <chr>, yarn_weight_crochet_gauge <lgl>,\n#   yarn_weight_id <dbl>, yarn_weight_knit_gauge <chr>, yarn_weight_name <chr>,\n#   yarn_weight_ply <dbl>, yarn_weight_wpi <chr>, texture_clean <chr>, and\n#   abbreviated variable names ¹​gauge_divisor, ²​machine_washable, ³​max_gauge,\n#   ⁴​min_gauge, ⁵​permalink, ⁶​rating_average\n\n\nThe Data Available from Ravelry consists of many varables of interest. For my analysis I chose to primarily look at the average rating, yarn weight name and the company that sells the specific yarns.\n\n\nShow the code\ndf <- yarn %>%\n  select(yarn_company_name, rating_average, yarn_weight_name) %>%\n  tidyr::drop_na()\nhead(df)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  yarn_company_name rating_average yarn_weight_name\n  <chr>                      <dbl> <chr>           \n1 Red Heart                   3.58 Aran            \n2 Caron                       4.03 Aran            \n3 Cascade Yarns ®             4.48 Worsted         \n4 Lion Brand                  3.87 Aran            \n5 Malabrigo Yarn              4.73 Aran            \n6 Malabrigo Yarn              4.81 Worsted         \n\n\nI have been interested in learning more about different yarn companies so I chose to look at which brands had the highest number of perfect ratings in the data set.\nI began by filtering only the yarns with a perfect rating and summarized the number of yarns each company had. Some brands only had a few yarns that fit that requirement so I narrowed my scope to only those with more than thirty perfectly rated yarns.\n\n\nShow the code\nhigh_ratings = df %>%\n  filter(rating_average == 5.00) %>%\n  group_by(yarn_company_name) %>%\n  summarize(totalnumber = n()) %>%\n  arrange(desc(totalnumber)) %>%\n  filter(totalnumber > 30) \nhead(high_ratings)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  yarn_company_name    totalnumber\n  <chr>                      <int>\n1 ColourMart                   169\n2 Ice Yarns                     99\n3 Lana Grossa                   66\n4 Woll Butt                     62\n5 Chester Wool Company          60\n6 Zauberwiese                   54\n\n\nIn order to display the top brands I created a separate dataframe that held only the top three brands.\n\n\nShow the code\ntop3 = df %>%\n  filter(rating_average == 5.00) %>%\n  group_by(yarn_company_name) %>%\n  summarize(totalnumber = n()) %>%\n  arrange(desc(totalnumber)) %>%\n  filter(totalnumber > 30) %>%\n  head(3)\ntop3\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  yarn_company_name totalnumber\n  <chr>                   <int>\n1 ColourMart                169\n2 Ice Yarns                  99\n3 Lana Grossa                66\n\n\nMy final graphical analysis shows that ColourMart, Ice Yarns, and Lana Grossa have the highest number of 5 point reviews for their yarns\n\n\nShow the code\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(data = high_ratings,aes(y = fct_reorder(yarn_company_name, totalnumber), x = totalnumber), fill = \"grey\") +\n  geom_col(data = top3, aes(y = fct_reorder(yarn_company_name, totalnumber), x = totalnumber), fill = \"darkred\") +\n  labs(\n    title= \"Which Yarn Company has the highest number of perfect ratings?\",\n    x = \"Total Number of 5 star ratings\",\n    y = \"Company Name\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()"
