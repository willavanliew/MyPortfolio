    "text": "Background\nRavelry is one of the largest online fiber works sites available. I use the platform to find new and exciting patterns to knit for myself and my friends and family.  In October of 2022 Tidy Tuesday shared yarn data available on Ravelry to the data science community for analysis.\nThe code I reviewed for my analysis comes from GitHub user Alice Walsh\n\nOriginal Data Set\nThe Data Available from Ravelry consists of many variables of interest. For my analysis I chose to primarily look at the average rating, yarn weight name and the company that sells the specific yarns.\n\n\nShow the code\ndf <- yarn %>%\n  select(yarn_company_name, rating_average, yarn_weight_name) %>%\n  tidyr::drop_na()\n\n\nI have been interested in learning more about different yarn companies so I chose to look at which brands had the highest number of perfect ratings in the data set.\nI began by filtering only the yarns with a perfect rating and summarized the number of yarns each company had. Some brands only had a few yarns that fit that requirement so I narrowed my scope to only those with more than thirty perfectly rated yarns.\n\n\nShow the code\nhigh_ratings = df %>%\n  filter(rating_average == 5.00) %>%\n  group_by(yarn_company_name) %>%\n  summarize(totalnumber = n()) %>%\n  arrange(desc(totalnumber)) %>%\n  filter(totalnumber > 30) \n\n\nIn order to display the top brands I created a separate dataframe that held only the top three brands.\n\n\nShow the code\ntop3 = df %>%\n  filter(rating_average == 5.00) %>%\n  group_by(yarn_company_name) %>%\n  summarize(totalnumber = n()) %>%\n  arrange(desc(totalnumber)) %>%\n  filter(totalnumber > 30) %>%\n  head(3)\n\n\nMy final graphical analysis shows that ColourMart, Ice Yarns, and Lana Grossa have the highest number of 5 point reviews for their yarns\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(data = high_ratings,aes(y = fct_reorder(yarn_company_name, totalnumber), x = totalnumber), fill = \"grey\") +\n  geom_col(data = top3, aes(y = fct_reorder(yarn_company_name, totalnumber), x = totalnumber), fill = \"darkred\") +\n  labs(\n    title= \"Which Yarn Company has the highest number of perfect ratings?\",\n    x = \"Total Number of 5 star ratings\",\n    y = \"Company Name\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()"

As a child my father would put on ski movies after a long day on the slopes, most of the movies we would watch would have at least one scene of a professional skier or snowboarder riding down a slope as an avalanche is triggered. Much like quicksand I thought avalanches would be a very big worry as a grew older, but when one skis at a sanctioned ski resort avalanche dangers are slim to none if you are careful.\nBut I was still curious about them, I wanted to know when they actually occur and how they are triggered. I came across an expansive data set from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center and attempted to answer some of the questions I had."
