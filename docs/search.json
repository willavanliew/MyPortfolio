In October of 2022 Tidy Tuesday shared yarn data available on Ravelry to the data science community for analysis. The code I reviewed for my analysis comes from GitHub user Alice Walsh\n\nOriginal Data Set\n\nhead(yarn)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 24\n  discontinued gauge…¹ grams    id machi…² max_g…³ min_g…⁴ name  perma…⁵ ratin…⁶\n  <lgl>          <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <lgl>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr> <chr>     <dbl>\n1 FALSE              4   198  2059 TRUE         NA      17 Supe… red-he…    3.58\n2 FALSE              4   170  3330 TRUE         NA      18 Simp… caron-…    4.03\n3 FALSE              4   100   523 NA           20      18 Casc… cascad…    4.48\n4 FALSE              4   100  5741 TRUE         NA      16 Vann… lion-b…    3.87\n5 FALSE              4   100  1666 NA           NA      18 Wors… malabr…    4.73\n6 FALSE              4   100 62569 TRUE         22      18 Rios  malabr…    4.81\n# … with 14 more variables: rating_count <dbl>, rating_total <dbl>,\n#   texture <chr>, thread_size <dbl>, wpi <dbl>, yardage <dbl>,\n#   yarn_company_name <chr>, yarn_weight_crochet_gauge <lgl>,\n#   yarn_weight_id <dbl>, yarn_weight_knit_gauge <chr>, yarn_weight_name <chr>,\n#   yarn_weight_ply <dbl>, yarn_weight_wpi <chr>, texture_clean <chr>, and\n#   abbreviated variable names ¹​gauge_divisor, ²​machine_washable, ³​max_gauge,\n#   ⁴​min_gauge, ⁵​permalink, ⁶​rating_average\n\n\nThe Data Available from Ravelry consists of many varables of interest. For my analysis I chose to primarily look at the average rating, yarn weight name and the company that sells the specific yarns.\n\n\nShow the code\ndf <- yarn %>%\n  select(yarn_company_name, rating_average, yarn_weight_name) %>%\n  tidyr::drop_na()\n\n\nI have been interested in learning more about different yarn companies so I chose to look at which brands had the highest number of perfect ratings in the data set.\nI began by filtering only the yarns with a perfect rating and summarized the number of yarns each company had. Some brands only had a few yarns that fit that requirement so I narrowed my scope to only those with more than thirty perfectly rated yarns.\n\n\nShow the code\nhigh_ratings = df %>%\n  filter(rating_average == 5.00) %>%\n  group_by(yarn_company_name) %>%\n  summarize(totalnumber = n()) %>%\n  arrange(desc(totalnumber)) %>%\n  filter(totalnumber > 30) \n\n\nIn order to display the top brands I created a separate dataframe that held only the top three brands.\n\n\nShow the code\ntop3 = df %>%\n  filter(rating_average == 5.00) %>%\n  group_by(yarn_company_name) %>%\n  summarize(totalnumber = n()) %>%\n  arrange(desc(totalnumber)) %>%\n  filter(totalnumber > 30) %>%\n  head(3)\n\n\nMy final graphical analysis shows that ColourMart, Ice Yarns, and Lana Grossa have the highest number of 5 point reviews for their yarns\n\n\nShow the code\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(data = high_ratings,aes(y = fct_reorder(yarn_company_name, totalnumber), x = totalnumber), fill = \"grey\") +\n  geom_col(data = top3, aes(y = fct_reorder(yarn_company_name, totalnumber), x = totalnumber), fill = \"darkred\") +\n  labs(\n    title= \"Which Yarn Company has the highest number of perfect ratings?\",\n    x = \"Total Number of 5 star ratings\",\n    y = \"Company Name\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()"

    "text": "Background\nI have been skiing for a very long time. As a child my father would put on ski movies after a long day on the slopes, most of the movies we would watch would have at least one scene of a professional skier or snowboarder riding down a slope as an avalanche is triggered. Much like quicksand I thought avalanches would be a very big worry as a grew older, but when one skis at a sanctioned ski resort avalanche dangers are slim to none if you are careful.\nBut I was still curious about them, I wanted to know when they actually occur and how they are triggered. I came across an expansive data set from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center and attempted to answer some of the questions I had."
